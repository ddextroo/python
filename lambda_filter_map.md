# Python Lambda, Filter, and Map Cheatsheet

In Python, lambda functions, the `filter()` function, and the `map()` function are powerful tools for working with iterable data structures and applying functions to elements. This cheatsheet provides a comprehensive guide to these concepts, including syntax and practical examples.

## Lambda Functions

Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are small, one-line functions that can be defined without a name. They are often used for quick, throwaway operations.

### Syntax
```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

### Example
```python
# Define a lambda function that squares a number
square = lambda x: x**2
result = square(5)  # Result will be 25
```

Lambda functions can take multiple arguments and can be used for various operations such as sorting and key extraction in sorting functions.

```python
# Sort a list of tuples based on the second element using a lambda function
data = [(2, 7), (1, 4), (5, 2)]
sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Result will be [(5, 2), (1, 4), (2, 7)]
```

## Filter

The `filter()` function is used to filter elements from an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) based on a specified condition.

### Syntax
```python
filter(function, iterable)
```

### Example
```python
# Filter even numbers from a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))  # Result will be [2, 4, 6]
```

The `filter()` function returns an iterator, so you often convert it to a list to see the filtered results.

```python
# Filter names starting with 'A' from a list of names
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Alex", "David"]
a_names = list(filter(lambda name: name.startswith('A'), names))  # Result will be ['Alice', 'Alex']
```

## Map

The `map()` function is used to apply a function to each element of an iterable and return a new iterable with the results.

### Syntax
```python
map(function, iterable)
```

### Example
```python
# Double each element in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))  # Result will be [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

The `map()` function can be used to transform data by applying a given function to each element in an iterable.

```python
# Convert a list of Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit using a lambda function
celsius_temperatures = [0, 25, 100]
fahrenheit_temperatures = list(map(lambda celsius: (celsius * 9/5) + 32, celsius_temperatures))  # Result will be [32.0, 77.0, 212.0]
```

## Combined Example

You can use lambda, filter, and map together to perform more complex operations.

```python
# Filter even numbers and then double them
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)))  # Result will be [4, 8, 12]
```

This cheatsheet provides a detailed overview of lambda functions, `filter()`, and `map()` functions in Python, along with practical examples of their usage.

For more advanced use cases and details, refer to the official Python documentation.
