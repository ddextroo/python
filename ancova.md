The one-way ANCOVA model can be represented as:

\[Y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}\]

Where:

- \(Y_{ij}\) is the observed value of the dependent variable for the \(i\)-th subject in the \(j\)-th group.
- \(\beta_0\) is the overall intercept or grand mean of the dependent variable.
- \(\beta_1\) is the coefficient for the covariate (\(X\)) representing the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable.
- \(X_{ij}\) is the covariate value for the \(i\)-th subject in the \(j\)-th group.
- \(\epsilon_{ij}\) is the error term or residual for the \(i\)-th subject in the \(j\)-th group, representing individual variation.

In the context of the one-way ANCOVA table:

1. **Source of Variation** is typically the "Between Groups" factor, representing the different groups or levels in the categorical variable (e.g., treatment groups).

2. **Sum of Squares (SS)**:
   - **SS_Between**: Measures the variation between group means.
   - **SS_Covariate**: Measures the variation due to the covariate.
   - **SS_Error**: Measures the unexplained or residual variation.

3. **Degrees of Freedom (DF)**:
   - **DF_Between**: The degrees of freedom for the Between Groups factor, typically equal to the number of groups minus one.
   - **DF_Covariate**: The degrees of freedom for the Covariate, which is usually 1.
   - **DF_Error**: The degrees of freedom for the Error term, calculated as the total sample size minus the sum of the other degrees of freedom.

4. **Mean Squares (MS)**:
   - **MS_Between**: Obtained by dividing SS_Between by DF_Between.
   - **MS_Covariate**: Obtained by dividing SS_Covariate by DF_Covariate (usually 1).
   - **MS_Error**: Obtained by dividing SS_Error by DF_Error.

5. **F-Statistic**:
   - The F-statistic is calculated by dividing the mean square for the Between Groups factor (MS_Between) by the mean square for the Error term (MS_Error). The F-statistic assesses whether the group means are significantly different after controlling for the covariate.

The goal of the one-way ANCOVA is to test whether the means of the dependent variable differ significantly between groups while accounting for the covariate's effect. The F-statistic is used to make this determination. If it is significantly different from 1, it suggests that there are significant group mean differences.
